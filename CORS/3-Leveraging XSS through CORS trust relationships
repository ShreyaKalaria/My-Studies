Even Deconstructed CORS looks for a trust relationship between two resources correctly. If a website relies on a resource that has cross-site scripting(XSS) open, XSS can be used to inject some JavaScript that uses an attacker CORS. Dec.
When the following request is taken into consideration:

GET/api/requestApiKey HTTP/1.1
Host: website.com
Origin: https://subdomain.website.com
Cookie: sessionid=...

If the server responds as follows :
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: https://subdomain.website.com
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

Then the attacker subdomain.website.com XSS is injected using the URL. Then the attacker obtains the victim's API key.
