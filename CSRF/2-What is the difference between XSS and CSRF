Cross-site scripting (or XSS) allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the browser of a victim user.

Cross-site request forgery (or CSRF) allows an attacker to induce a victim user to perform actions that they do not intend to.

The XSS vulnerability consequences are usually more serious than CSRF vulnerabilities. 
CSRF usually applies to the subset of actions that a user is able to perform. But a successful XSS exploit , regardless of the functionality in which the vulnerability appeared, noraml can perform an action that the user can trigger.
CSRF can be defined as a one-way vulnerability. because he makes an aggressive request, but he doesn't get an answer. Conversely, XSS is bidirectional.  He sends the attack and reads the incoming response.
