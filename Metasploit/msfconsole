Metasploit has a number of modules to scan open ports on the target system and network. You can list potential port scanning modules available using the "search portscan" command.
    --CONCURRENCY: Number of targets to be scanned simultaneously.
    --PORTS: Port range to be scanned. Please note that 1-1000 here will not be the same as using Nmap with the default configuration. Nmap will scan the 1000 most used ports, while Metasploit will scan port numbers from 1 to 10000.
    --RHOSTS: Target or target network to be scanned.
    --THREADS: Number of threads that will be used simultaneously. More threads will result in faster scans.

The "scanner/discovery/udp_sweep" module will allow you to quickly identify services running over the UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

SMB Scans >>>"smb_enumshares" and "smb_version"

NETBÄ°OS scanner "scanner/netbios/nbname"

HTTP verison scanner "http_version"

If you run a Nmap scan using the "db_nmap" shown below, all results will be saved to the database.
