Discovery can be defined as preliminary research to gather information about a target. We divide exploration into two:
1-Passive Discovery
2-Active exploration
 In passive discovery, we rely on publicly available information. Information that we can access from open sources without directly communicating with the target. We can think of it as if we are looking at the target area from afar without stepping foot in that area.

Passive reconnaissance activities include many activities, such as:
=>Scanning a domain's DNS records from a public DNS server.
=> To follow the advertisements related to the target website.
=> Reading articles about the target company.

 Active reconnaissance cannot be done so covertly. It communicates directly with the target. Think of it like checking locks on doors and windows, among other potential entry points.

Here are some examples of active exploration activities:
=>Connecting to one of the company servers such as HTTP, FT and SMTP,
=> To call the company for information (Social engineering),
=> Entering the company building in disguise.
Given the invasive nature of active exploration, one can quickly run into legal trouble if proper legal clearance is not obtained.

a::whois
    Whois is a request and response protocol that follows the RFC 3912 specification. The whois server responds to various information about the requested domain. Of particular interest we can learn about:
    --Registered company name, through which company establishment the domain was registered.
    --Registerer's contact information, Name, organization, address, phone and other information (unless hidden)
    --Creation, update and expiration dates.
    --name server

    for example:
        whois indeed.com                            
        Domain Name: INDEED.COM
        Registry Domain ID: 1039468_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN

b:nslookup
    nslookup helps us find the IP address of the incoming domain name. It can be used alone as well as with an option.
    example:
        nslookup indeed.com
        Server: 192.168.1.1
        Address: 192.168.1.1#53

        Non-authoritative answer:
        Name: indeed.com
        Address: 162.159.130.67
        Name: indeed.com
        Address: 162.159.129.67

    In general, we can define it as follows.
    nslookup OPTIONS DOMAIN_NAME SERVER
    :::Options: The option we want to scan, for example, A,AA,MX etc.
    :::Domanin_name: This is the domain we are looking for.
    :::Server: This is the DNS server we want to query.
    ::::::::::::CloudFlare 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1
    ::::::::::::Google 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4

    Query Type          Result
        A             IPv4 Addresses
        AAAA          IPv6 Addresses
        CNAME         Canonical Name
        MX            Mail Servers
        SOA           Authority start
        TXT           TXT Records
    As an example, "nslookup -type=A indeed.com 1.1.1.1" can be used.
c:dig(Domain Information Groper)
    For additional functionality we can use the DIg command. It is similar to use with nslookup.
    dig @SERVER DOMAIN_NAME TYPE
        Server is the DNS server we want to query.
        Domain_name is the domain name we are looking for.
        Type contains the DNS record type as in the table provided in the previous table.
    For example; "dig @1.1.1.1 indeed.com MX"
d:DNSDumpster
    https://dnsdumpster.com/, bir web sitesidir. Alt alanları tespit edebilmek için kullanılmaktadır.
e:shodan
    When you are tasked with pentesting against certain targets as part of the passive discovery phase, a service like Shodan.io can be helpful to learn various information about the client's network without being actively connected. Also, on the defensive side, you can get information about the connected and exposed devices of your institution by using different services of Shodan.io. It is a paid program.
    Through this Shodan.io search result, we can learn a few things about our search, for example:

       - IP address
       - hosting company
       - geolocation
       - server type and version
f:archive.org
    On the Archive.org website, there is a web biography of the entered domain name on the past dates, on the current dates.
