When we want to target a network, we want us to handle repetitive tasks and find answers to the following questions.
1- Which systems are open?
2- For which services do these systems work?
To scan with Nmap, we can use it with different options as follows.
::list: nmap 1.1.1.1 abc.example.com example.com
::range: nmap 10.10.10.10-20
::subnet: nmap 1.1.1.1/30
::We can provide input for your target list in a file: nmap -iL subdomain.txt
::For list of hosts: nmap -sL Targets
::When we don't want to scan DNS server: nmap -n 1.1.1.1
::Discovering online hosts without port scanning on live systems: nmap -sn TARGETS
If you want ::Nmap to only perform an ARP scan without a port scan, you can use: "nmap -PR -sn TARGETS" -PR specifies the ARP request.
::We scanned the target's subnet "nmap -PE -sec MACHINE_IP/24"
In an attempt to discover live hosts using ::ICMP address mask queries, we run the command: "nmap -PM -sn MACHINE_IP/24"
If you want ::Nmap to use TCP SYN ping-PS, you can do so via the option followed by port number, range, list, or a combination of these. For example, "-PS2121" targets port "-PS21-25", while ports 21, 22, 23, 24, and 25 "-PS80,443,8080".
::TCP ACK ping scan: nmap -PA -sec MACHINE_IP/24
::UDP ACK ping scan: nmap -PU -sec MACHINE_IP/24
::Port scanning option is done with "-p", if this is not written in the query, 1000 ports will be scanned by default."-p25,-p21-25,-p22,21, --to-ports 100".
::We want it to issue a reverse DNS lookup for all possible hosts on a subnet: nmap -r 1.1.1.1

    At the risk of oversimplification, we can classify ports in two states:

    Open port indicates that there is some service listening on that port.
    Closed port indicates that there is no service listening on that port.
    However, in practical situations, we need to consider the impact of firewalls. For instance, a port might be open, but a firewall might be blocking the packets. Therefore, Nmap considers the following six states:

    ""Open: indicates that a service is listening on the specified port.
    ""Closed: indicates that no service is listening on the specified port, although the port is accessible. By accessible, we mean that it is reachable and is not blocked by a firewall or other security appliances/programs.
    ""Filtered: means that Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed because the port is not accessible. This state is usually due to a firewall preventing Nmap from reaching that port. Nmap’s packets may be blocked from reaching the port; alternatively, the responses are blocked from reaching Nmap’s host.
    ""Unfiltered: means that Nmap cannot determine if the port is open or closed, although the port is accessible. This state is encountered when using an ACK scan -sA.
    ""Open|Filtered: This means that Nmap cannot determine whether the port is open or filtered.
    ""Closed|Filtered: This means that Nmap cannot decide whether a port is closed or filtered.

::To illustrate the -sT (TCP connect scan), the following command example returned a detailed list of the open ports: nmap -sT MACHINE_IP
::The default number of scanned pots is 1000. We use -F to make it 100.
::We use the -r option to scan for ports in a default order.
::TCP SYN scan is the default scan mode and a very reliable choice when running Nmap as a privileged user, running as root or using sudo. nmap -sS 10.10.10.11
We use the -sU option to scan for UDP: nmap -sU 10.10.10.11
::We have the opportunity to adjust the scanning speed between -T0 and -T5. -T5 is the fastest and -T0 is the slowest. Values ​​in between are also valid. When this option is not typed, the default is -T3. nmap -T4 10.10.10.10
::Our option to send empty packets: nmap -sN 10.10.10.10
::FIN scan sends a TCP packet with the FIN flag set: nmap -sF 10.10.10.10
::Xmas scan sets FIN, PSH and URG flags at the same time. You can choose Xmas scan with option -sX. Like blank scan and FIN scan, if an RST packet is received it means the port is down: nmap -sX 10.10.10.10
::As the name suggests, an ACK scan sends a TCP packet with the ACK flag set. Use the option to select this scan. -sA: nmap -sA 10.10.10.10
::TCP window scan is almost the same as ACK scan; however, it examines the TCP Window area of ​​the returned RST packets. On certain systems this may reveal that the port is open: nmap -sW 10.10.10.10
::In some network setups you will be able to scan a target system using a fake IP address or even a fake MAC address : nmap -S SPOOFED_IP MACHINE_IP
::Nmap gives the option to shred "-f" packages. Once selected, the IP data will be split into 8 bytes or less. Adding -f another ( -f -f or ) -ff splits the data into chunks of 16 bytes instead of 8. Its default value is --mtu; however, you should always choose multiples of 8.
nmap -ff 10.10.10.10, incoming packets are 16 bytes in size.
If you want ::nmap to give more details about its rationale and results, consider adding: nmap -sS --reason 10.10.10.10
:: Use -v or -vv option to get a more detailed output.
:: Debug -d or -dd option is used.
