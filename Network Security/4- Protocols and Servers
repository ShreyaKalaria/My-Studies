1-telnet
    The Telnet protocol is an application layer protocol used to connect to a virtual terminal of another computer. Using Telnet, a user can log into another computer and access its terminal (console) to run programs, start batch processes, and perform system administration tasks remotely.
    telnet 10.10.251.166 23 , used from.
2-http
    Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the protocol used to transfer web pages. Your web browser connects to the webserver and uses HTTP to request HTML pages and images among other files and submit forms and upload various files. Anytime you browse the World Wide Web (WWW), you are certainly using the HTTP protocol.
    telnet 10.10.10.10 80, HTTP default port is 80.
3-ftp
    File Transfer Protocol (FTP) was developed to make the transfer of files between different computers with different systems efficient.
    ftp admin@10.10.10.10
    "mget" is used to download files from FTP.
    telnet 10.10.10.10 21, FTP default port is 21.
4-SMTP(Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
    Email is one of the most used services on the Internet. There are various configurations for email servers; for instance, you may set up an email system to allow local users to exchange emails with each other with no access to the Internet. However, we will consider the more general setup where different email servers connect over the Internet.
    telnet 10.10.10.10 25, SMTP default port is 25.
5-POP3(Post Office protocol 3)
    Post Office Protocol version 3 (POP3) is a protocol used to download the email messages from a Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) server, as shown in the figure below. The mail client connects to the POP3 server, authenticates, downloads the new email messages before (optionally) deleting them.
    telnet 10.10.10.10 110, POP3 default port is 110.
6-İMAP(Internet Message Access Protocol)
    Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is more sophisticated than POP3. IMAP makes it possible to keep your email synchronized across multiple devices (and mail clients). In other words, if you mark an email message as read when checking your email on your smartphone, the change will be saved on the IMAP server (MDA) and replicated on your laptop when you synchronize your inbox.
    telnet 10.10.10.10 143, İMAP default port is 143.
