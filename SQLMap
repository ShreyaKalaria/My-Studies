Sqlmap is an open source sql injection vulnerability detection and exploitation tool. It detects the type of sql injection on the system by sending various queries/commands to the database system used by the target web application provided to it. Again, it takes various information from the target database according to the parameters provided to it.

sqlmap -r requests.txt -dmbs=mysql --dump
    -r uses the intercepted request you saved earlier
    -dbms tells SQLMap what type of database management system it is
    --dump attempts to outputs the entire database

    To use sqlmap, after the user is logged in, we save any query via burp and scan it over sqlmap.
